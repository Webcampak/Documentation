For example, if a source is configured to capture every:\n\n\n\n\n20s\n: The capture process will be triggered at 5:00\"00, 5:00\"20, 5:00\"40, 6:00\"00, etc...\n\n\n10mn\n: The capture process will be triggered at 5:00\"00, 5:10\"00, 5:20\"00, 5:30\"00, etc...\n\n\n\n\nTo get a \"clean\" and consistent output we recommend using one of the following settings:\n\n\n\n\nSeconds\n: 10, 20, 30\n\n\nMinutes\n: 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60\n\n\n\n\nNote: a 10s capture frequency will highly depend of your hardware, and might not be feasible in most situations.\n\n\nPrecise Capture Time\n\n\nWhen capturing from a D-SLR camera, and depending of multiple factors, the actual capture process might be triggered a few miliseconds or seconds after the defined interval. Depending if you care about time accuracy or not, you can specify if the picture should take the time it the capture request was sent (interval time) or the time the picture was actually captured.\n\n\nFilename\n\n\nWebcampak uses the capture time in file naming, using the following convention: YYYYMMDDHHmmSS (YearMonthDayHourMinuteSecond). For example 20170224124007.jpg is a picture captured on February (02) 24th, 2017 at 12:40 and 07 seconds.\n\n\nTo prevent too many files from being stored in the same directory (which creates issue for very long projects) pictures are stored in a directory corresponding to the picture's day, for example, filepath for the above picture will be: pictures/20170224/20170224124007.jpg\n\n\nCalendar\n\n\nA 24h format weekly calendar is available in each source to identify when to capture pictures (day of the week, time of the day).\n\n\nIf you want to enable variable capture rate (for example capture business hours at a different rate than outside business hours), you would configure two sources with a different non-overlapping capture calendar.\n\n\nNon-overlapping sources\n\n\nWhen configuring sources to capture from the same physical source (i.e. same D-SLR camera), be cautious not to have overlapping capture requests. Cameras can only handle one capture at a time and which source will get the picture will be \"first-come-first-served\", with the other source failing and the risk of causing the camera to crash.\n\n\nRAW Files\n\n\nRaw pictures are stored in a specific sub-directory, for the above picture it will be: pictures/raw/20170224/20170224124007.jpg\n\n\nIt might be useful to understand that, in webcampak, raw pictures are mostly considered as a supplement to jpg pictures, but picture manipulation happens on jpg pictures only.

This number must be unique but do not have to follow a sequence. For example, the FTP account for the source will be sourceX, with X being this number.\n\n\nWeight\n: Numerical value used for sorting purposes, the lowest number will be first. This number does not have to be unique, if multiple sources have the same weight, they will be sorted by name.\n\n\nQuota (GB)\n: Quota to be allocated for the source.

At any time, you will be able to roll-back to previous settings.\n\n\n\n\nAll changes to the configuration settings are logged by webcampak (who modified what, when), those logs are available in a dedicated section of the interface. All webcampak actions are logged, we strongly encourage users to consult those logs while the system is configured to learn more about all specificities of the capture process. Various metrics are also captured and those logs will contains details such as individual actions processing time, picture date, picture size, entire processing time, etc...\n\n\nCapture\n\n\nThis tab allows you to configure all settings directly related to picture acquisition.\n\n\nSource Configuration\n\n\nThe following configuration settings are available in this section:\n\n\n\n\nActivate Source\n: Activate the source or not, if inactive, no action will be taken (no pictures, no videos).\n\n\nSource Type\n: Type of picture acquisition mechanism to be processed by the source.\n\n\nCapture Every\n: Interval at which the source will try to capture a picture.\n\n\nMinimum Interval\n: Minimum interval between two pictures. This acts more as a safeguard to avoid overloading the system by misconfiguration. Ideally, this number should be set to the longer capture time during the source operation window.\n\n\nCapture Delay\n: Delay before initiating capture. This is useful for chained sources to avoid processing delays.\n\n\nPicture Date\n: Select if date attached to the picture should be the script start time, or the actual picture acquisition time.\n\n\nTimezone\n: Timezone of the source\n\n\nLanguage\n: Language to be used by the source\n\n\nProcess RAW\n: Enable RAW pictures acquisition \n processing\n\n\nCapture Sensors\n: Enable Phidgets sensors acquisition just after picture processing\n\n\nEmail alerts\n: Enable email alerts for the source\n\n\nBlock capture\n: Block capture, disable the capture process while leaving the source active\n\n\n\n\nCapture Calendar\n\n\nThe following configuration settings are available in this section:\n\n\n\n\nEnable Calendar\n: If disable, the system will capture 24/7, if enabled it will capture at days selected below.\n\n\nMonday - Sunday\n: Enable capture this particular day, between those hours (24h format)\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration of D-SLR USB Camera (Gphoto2 PTP mode)\n\n\nThose settings are only used when multiple D-SLR cameras are physically connected to the same webcampak.\n\n\nThe following configuration settings are available in this section:\n\n\n\n\nCamera Model\n: Camera Model\n\n\nCamera Port\n: USB port of the camera, the system will auto detect available formats\n\n\nCamera Owner (TAG)\n: User-defined TAG to assigned to the camera and used to verify which camera is which in case 2 identical models are connected\n\n\nGphoto2 Debug\n: Run gphoto2 in debug mode, giving much more verbose output. Do not use this in production\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration of Webcampak Source\n\n\nThose settings are used when pictures are coming from another webcampak source (chained sources).\n\n\nThe following configuration settings are available in this section:\n\n\n\n\nSelect capture mode\n: Two mode are available \"Get\" or \"Receive\". If \"Get\", the source will actually try to capture the latest picture from the other source, this mode can only be used for local sources. If \"Receive\", the source will process pictures uploaded to its /tmp/ directory, this mode is usually used when remote webcampak are sending their pictures.\n\n\nSelect source to get from\n: Source to get the picture from if \"Get\" is selected in \"Select capture mode\".\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration of IP Camera (FTP) / Webcampak\n\n\nThose settings are used to process pictures uploaded to the /tmp/ directory, whether those are coming from IP Cameras or remote Webcampak.\n\n\nThe following configuration settings are available in this section:\n\n\n\n\nDefine picture date based upon\n: Various methods are available to identify the picture's date. Additional parsers can be added to process more source types.\n\n\nLimit hotlink processing to one picture per rotation\n: This setting prevent multiple hotlinks to be created is multiple pictures are processed in batch. In this case only the hotlinks corresponding to the first picture are generated.\n\n\nTake actions if no new pictures in /tmp/ directory\n: Trigger alerts if no new pictures are available in /tmp/ directory.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration of Internet Picture or Video Streaming\n\n\nThose settings are used to process pictures by acquiring a remote image of video stream. \n\n\n\n\nURL File/Stream\n: URL of the remote resource.\n\n\n\n\nPictures\n\n\nThis section of the configuration allows you to define manipulations to be applied to pictures right after their capture.\n\n\nThose settings are exectued in sequence in the order available in the configuration screen (picutre is first rotated, then rotated picture is cropped, etc ...).\n\n\nRotate picture\n\n\nThis option can be used to rotate the picture, clockwise, by a specific angle. Note that this feature is compute intensive and will impact duration of the capture process.\n\n\nIt should preferably be used on webcampak cloud or on webcampak devices with low capture rate.\n\n\nCrop picture\n\n\nThis option can be used to crop the picture to a specific area, this is especially useful if you want to focus on a specific portion of a picture. The system asks you to detail the size of the area (in pixels) and it's start location (in pixels) from the top-left corner of the source picture.\n\n\nInsert Watermark\n\n\nThis option can be used to insert a watermark into the picture. A watermark can simply be a logo, or be a more complex decoration around a picture (such as a specific box for the date, an improved legend, etc...).\n\n\nWatermak files are pulled from two locations:\n\n\n\n\nThe global webcampak /resources/watermark/ directory, shared between all sources. This directory is accessible via FTP through the \"wpresources\" account (see general configuration).\n\n\nThe local source's /resources/watermark/ directory. This directory is accessible via FTP through the source's FTP account (see FTP tab).\n\n\n\n\nTransparency (in %) with 0 being fully transparent and 100 being not transparent, can be defined as well as watermark's location from the top-left corner of the picture.\n\n\nInsert Text\n\n\nThis option can be used to insert some text (single line) into the picture, usually a legend. If a date format is specified, it will be appended at the end of the legend's text, following the selected format.\n\n\nThe text can be added to various areas of the picture (Text location), the user can then define coordinates as an offset (in pixels) from this location (X,Y). \nFor example selecting:\n\n\n\n\nText location\n: \"South West\" \n\n\nLegend Coordinates\n: 11,10\n\n\n\n\nWill place the bottom left corner of the text area, to start 11 pixels on the X axis and 10 pixels on the Y axis from the bottom left corner of the picture.\n\n\nAdding a shadow to the legend often makes the text more readable, the shadow is actually the same text, written behind the main text but with a different color and a slight pixel offset.\n\n\nNote: If more complex static code needs to be added, this can be done through the watermark feature.\n\n\nStatic pictures\n\n\nThis option can be used to create \"hotlinkable\" pictures, those constantly keep the same filename and are automatically replaced as new pictures are being captured.\n\n\nWebcampak can be configured to create 4 of those, which should give enough flexibility to for most use case (thumbnail link, full size, etc...).\n\n\nUsers can also chose to \"Generate error hotlink\", which, in case of failed capture, will replace the previous picture with an error message embedded in the picture.\n\n\nArchives\n\n\nThis section of the configuration contains various settings related to image size and clean-up:\n\n\n\n\nSave pictures into archives\n: If unselected, the picture will be deleted at the end of processing. This prevents any videos from being created, and might only be useful on very specific situations where this sources is only used as a temporary processing step. In most situations this should be selected. \n\n\nResize pictures before saving\n: Resize pictures to a specific format, using XxY format (in pixels), for example: 1024x768\n\n\nMinimum single picture size\n: Minimum size, in bytes, of the picture. If below the system will consider the capture failed.\n\n\nDelete pictures after\n: Automatically delete older directories after X days. Note that it delete a full day at once, not considering hours.\n\n\nMaximum archive size\n: Maximum size of the entire pictures, in MB. If over, will delete a full day of pictures at each rotation, starting with the oldest day. \n\n\n\n\nSend pictures via FTP\n\n\nThis option is used to specify FTP servers to send pictures to. Those servers are defined in the FTP tab.\n\n\nUnless the option is selected, RAW files are not being sent to remote servers. Users can also specify the number of retries, in case of transmission failure. On top of sending the FTP command to send the picture. Webcampak also compares exact file size (bytes) at the end of the transfer, if files are different, it will consider that transfer failed.\n\n\nCopy pictures internally\n\n\nThis option is used to copy pictures to another source within the webcampak. \n\n\nVideos\n\n\nThis section is used to configure videos generated daily (processing starts by default at 1am) by the system. 4 video definitions (1080p, 720p, 480p, custom) are supported by default, and 2 video formats (H.264 and MP4).\n\n\nSimilar to the \"Pictures\" section, picture manipulation settings are applied in sequence, following the configuration screen order.\n\n\nDaily video creation\n\n\nIn this section, users can select video definition and formats, and frames per seconds (FPS).\n\n\nPlease note that the MP4 file is generated by converted the H.264 file, so MP4 files alone cannot be created, the corresponding H.264 option must be selected.\n\n\nAdvanced video settings\n\n\nThis section offer default configuration for most settings of 1080p, 720p, 480p definitions. Since in a vast majority of situations, source pictures are converted from 4:3 aspect ratio, only the last parameter (Y axis) of the crop is customizable (this is on purpose).\n\n\nFor example, for 1080p, settings are:\n * \nBitrate\n: 10000\n * \nSize\n: 1920x-3\n * \nCrop\n: 1920:1080:0:0\n\n\nThe system will take the initial pidcture definition (for example 5616x3744 for a Canon 5D MII) it will resize its width to 1920 while maintaining the aspect ratio (-3 parameter). The resulting picture will have a definition of 1920x1280, it will then crop this picture for the video (Width:Height:X:Y), and since we already have the correct width the only parameter we want to customize is the Y offset. In our example:\n\n\n\n\n1920:1080:0:0 - means we cut the bottom 200 pixels of the picture\n\n\n1920:1080:0:100 - means we cut 100 pixels at the top and the bottom of the picture\n\n\n1920:1080:0:200 - means we cut the top 200 pixels of the picture\n\n\n\n\nThe custom parameter lets you personalize all settings. May you have sufficient compute power and memory resources, the system could generat 4K or 8K videos.\n\n\nFilter similar pictures\n\n\nThis system lets you compare the (difference)[https://www.pureftpd.org/project/libpuzzle] between two pictures using (puzzle-diff)[https://linux.die.net/man/8/puzzle-diff]. This difference is represented as a \"distance\", you will probably have to run a couple of sample videos to identify the best threshold for your video.\n\n\nFor greater accuracy, a watermark can be defined, this watermak is applied by webcampak on each picture before calculating the difference. For example on a construction site, you might want to add a black watermark covering everything which does not deal with the building you are capturing. This way, the difference will only be calculated if something changed on the building itself (not capturing clouds movements for example).\n\n\nThe difference is a calculated between two consecutive pictures. For example PIC-1 is compared with PIC-2, if PIC-2 in over the threshold, it's not selected and PIC-1 is compared with PIC-3, then PIC-3 is compared with PIC-4, PIC-4 is compared with PIC-5, and so on.\n\n\nPlease note that this can slightly increase video creation runtime depending of the number of calculations to be executed.\n\n\nInsert Watermark\n\n\nPlease refer to the Watermark section of the pictures tab.\n\n\nPre-processing manipulations (Advanced)\n\n\nThis sections lets you add a legend to your video (please refer to the text section of the picture tab).\n\n\nIt can also be used to resize pictures before video creation (this might have a positive impact on video creation time). Original pictures are not impacted by this setting.\n\n\nAdd an audio file\n\n\nWebcampak let you add an audio track to your videos.\n\n\nTo add an audio track, login into global FTP account (wpresources) and copy MP3 files to /audio/ directory. This directory is shared between all sources.\n\n\nMP3 filenames must only contain regular characters without blank space.\n\n\nAdd an audio track: select this option to add an audio track.\n\n\nAudio file: select the file to be inserted.\n\n\nWebcampak is compliant with playlist upon some conditions. Create a \"playlist.m3u\" file, this file must contain a list of MP3 files (one file per line)\n\n\nExample of a \"playlist.m3u\" file\n\n\n01-Yellow.submarine.mp3\n02-Beat.it.mp3\nUpload all files (M3U and corresponding MP3) via FTP to /audio/ directory.\n\n\nDuring creation of the video, Webcampak will create a playlist.mp3 file, you can use this file for other videos and even rename it for later use.\n\n\nSend videos via FTP\n\n\nVideos can be uploaded to remote FTP servers defined in the FTP tab.\n\n\nCustom Vids\n\n\nMost settings in this tab are identical to those available in the \"Video\" tab, we will only focus on custom settings.\n\n\nCreate a custom video\n\n\nThis section let you configure settings directly related to video creation (which could take hours if creation span multiple months).\n\n\nBe careful with disk usage, Webcampak will copy all pictures to a temporary directory to apply modifications, as a result you will need free disk space corresponding to at least 2x the selected interval.\n\n\nFollowing settings are available:\n\n\n\n\nFilename (no spaces)\n: Choose the name for your video file, if an identical name already exists Webcampak will automatically append a random 4 digit number at the end of the filename.\n\n\nFrom\n: Select start date and hour.\n\n\nTo\n: Select end date and hour.\n\n\nKeep pictures between\n: only use pictures between a specific timeframe (i.e. between 8:00am and 7:00pm) to create video.\n\n\nMinimum time between two pictures\n: when preparing your video, Webcampak will check time between two captures, if lower than this value, the picture will be discarded.\n\n\nSend an email once creation completed\n: select this option to receive an email once video creation is completed.\n\n\nStart video creation\n: you can choose to start video creation as soon as possible or between 4h00 and 5h00 in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nPost-prod Vids.\n\n\nThis section of the configuration allows users to batch process a large number of pictures.\n\n\nSimilar to the \"Pictures\" section, picture manipulation settings are applied in sequence, following the configuration screen order.\n\n\nIt was created for two main purposes:\n\n\n\n\nReduce picture size: cropping/resizing pictures in batch reduces the overall size of pictures to be inserted into a video manipulation software.\n\n\nAdvanced picture selection: copying pictures to a dedicated source allows users to delete sequences by still keeping original pictures.\n\n\n\n\nThis section has a lot of similarities with \"Videos\" and \"Custom Videos\" sections but with much more functionalities. Once processing is completed you can use \"Custom Videos\" to generate a video of the target source.\n\n\nFilter similar pictures\n\n\nPlease refer to the \"Filter similar pictures\" section of the \"Custom Vids.\" tab.\n\n\nRotate picture\n\n\nPlease refer to the \"Rotate Picture\" section of the \"Pictures\" tab.\n\n\nCrop picture\n\n\nPlease refer to the \"Crop Picture\" section of the \"Pictures\" tab.\n\n\nTransition\n\n\nThis section allows users to progressive focus to a specific portion of the picture. \n\n\nIt works similarily to \"Crop\" but instead of applying the effect right away, it will calculate the number of frames between the first picture and last picture, and identify hwo to progressively modify the pictures to reach the selected coordinates.\n\n\nResize picture\n\n\nThis section allows users to resize pictures by specifying new dimensions in pixels.\n\n\nThumbnail\n\n\nThis section allows users to insert a thumbnail into a picture, it takes two main arguments:\n\n\n\n\nSize and location in a source, unmodified, picture (before any of the configured manipulations have been applied)\n\n\nSize and location in the destination, modified, picture (after configured manipulations have been applied)\n\n\n\n\nBy playing with various sizes, this allows users to play with focus area (zoom-in/out).\n\n\nInsert Watermark\n\n\nPlease refer to the \"Insert Watermak\" section of the \"Pictures\" tab.\n\n\nInsert a legend\n\n\nPlease refer to the \"Insert a legend\" section of the \"Pictures\" tab.\n\n\nInitiate processing\n\n\nThis section let you configure settings directly related to starting batch processing (which could take hours if creation span multiple months).\n\n\nBe careful with disk usage, Webcampak will copy all pictures to a temporary directory to apply modifications, as a result you will need free disk space corresponding to at least 2x the selected interval.\n\n\nFollowing settings are available:\n\n\n\n\nFrom\n: Select start date and hour.\n\n\nTo\n: Select end date and hour.\n\n\nKeep pictures between\n: only use pictures between a specific timeframe (i.e. between 8:00am and 7:00pm) to create video.\n\n\nMinimum interval between two pictures\n: when preparing your video, Webcampak will check time between two captures, if lower than this value, the picture will be discarded.\n\n\nMove pictures to\n: select the source you would like your pictures to be moved to.\n\n\nSend an email once creation completed\n: select this option to receive an email once video creation is completed.\n\n\nStart creation\n: you can choose to start video creation as soon as possible or between 4h00 and 5h00 in the morning.\n\n\n\n\nPhidgets\n\n\nThis section of the configuration allows users to configure interaction with Phidgets devices. Those are useful in multiple situations, and more specifically:\n\n\n\n\nPowercycle the camera after X number of failed captures\n\n\nCapture sensor values (temperature, humidity, etc...)\n\n\n\n\nRelays\n\n\nThis section allows users to define when to powercycle the camera (cutting power supply during a couple of seconds) in case of capture issues. The following settings are available:\n\n\n\n\nPowercycle the camera in case of failure\n: Option to be selected to activate power-cycling.\n\n\nNumber of failure before camera powercycle\n: How many failed capture before triggering the event.\n\n\nPhidget camera port\n: Port on the Phidgets board to which the relay is connected.\n\n\n\n\nNote that power-cycling will only be triggered when the condition is first met (camera will only be powercycled once).\n\n\nGraphs\n\n\nWebcampak can generate RRDGraphs out of captured sensor values, enabling this option will make Webcampak refresh its sensor graphs every 5mn.\n\n\nPhidgets graph get a static name, but changing sensors settings will trigger a new name to be created.\n\n\nGraphs can also be sent to a remote FTP server defined in the \"FTP\" tab.\n\n\nSensors Configuration\n\n\nUp to 4 different sensors can be configured in this section, by defining the following:\n\n\n\n\nType\n: Type of sensor connected to the board (temperature, pressure, humidity, etc...)\n\n\nPort\n: Port on the Phidgets board to which the sensor is connected\n\n\nLegend\n: Legend to be displayed on the RRDGraph may such graph be generated\n\n\nColor\n: Color of the RRDGraph may such graph be generated\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced\n\n\nThis sections allow users to configured more advanced parameters, and for now, dealing with email alerts.\n\n\nTime Based Alerts\n\n\nTime based alerts are triggered based on total elapsed time since last successful capture. This type of alert do not take into consideration any pre-configured schedule, it simply compare current time with last capture time.\n\n\nAt a pre-configured interval, the system will send a reminder about the failed status.\n\n\nSchedule Based Alerts (missed captures)\n\n\nSchedule based alerts are triggered based on calculating the number of missed captured since last successful capture. To use this part of the system, users will define in advance the expected weekly capture schedule.\n\n\nUsers can also configure a \"grace\" period, allowing for picture processing or data transfer time. During this grace period, calculated from last expected capture slot, the system will not take in consideration any possible failed capture.\n\n\nFor example, if the system expect a capture at 5:10 and the grace period is set to 5 mn, the system will only send an alert if the 5:10 picture is still missing at 5:15.\n\n\nFTP\n\n\nThis section of the configuration lets user configure local FTP credentials as well as list all remote FTP servers they would like to use.\n\n\nLocal FTP Account\n\n\nEach Webcampak has its own internal FTP server, you can use those credentials to connect directly to the source, to download or delete content, or to configure an other source to send pictures to this particular source.\n\n\nA password is generated automatically at source creation, you can change it at anytime.\n\n\nRemote FTP Servers\n\n\nSource-specific (not shared with other sources) remote FTP Servers can be configured in this screen, adding a remote FTP server takes the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nName\n: Local name used to reference the FTP server\n\n\nHost\n: Remote DNS name or IP Address\n\n\nUsername\n: Username on the remote FTP server\n\n\nPassword\n: Password on the remote FTP server\n\n\nDirectory\n: Directory where the content should be sent to\n\n\nActive\n: Enable \nFTP Active mode\n\n\nXfer Enable\n: Enable Xfer mode (transfer job queueing)\n\n\nXfer Threads\n: Number of parrallel transfer jobs supported by this server",

For example, for 1080p, settings are:\n *  Bitrate : 10000\n *  Size : 1920x-3\n *  Crop : 1920:1080:0:0  The system will take the initial pidcture definition (for example 5616x3744 for a Canon 5D MII) it will resize its width to 1920 while maintaining the aspect ratio (-3 parameter). The resulting picture will have a definition of 1920x1280, it will then crop this picture for the video (Width:Height:X:Y), and since we already have the correct width the only parameter we want to customize is the Y offset. In our example:   1920:1080:0:0 - means we cut the bottom 200 pixels of the picture  1920:1080:0:100 - means we cut 100 pixels at the top and the bottom of the picture  1920:1080:0:200 - means we cut the top 200 pixels of the picture   The custom parameter lets you personalize all settings. May you have sufficient compute power and memory resources, the system could generat 4K or 8K videos.",

This difference is represented as a \"distance\", you will probably have to run a couple of sample videos to identify the best threshold for your video.  For greater accuracy, a watermark can be defined, this watermak is applied by webcampak on each picture before calculating the difference. For example on a construction site, you might want to add a black watermark covering everything which does not deal with the building you are capturing. This way, the difference will only be calculated if something changed on the building itself (not capturing clouds movements for example).  The difference is a calculated between two consecutive pictures. For example PIC-1 is compared with PIC-2, if PIC-2 in over the threshold, it's not selected and PIC-1 is compared with PIC-3, then PIC-3 is compared with PIC-4, PIC-4 is compared with PIC-5, and so on.
