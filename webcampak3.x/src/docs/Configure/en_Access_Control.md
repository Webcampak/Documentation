# Access Control

The access control sections deals with who can access what, along with the definition of what the "what" is and who the "who" are.

This screen will let you define users, groups customers and sources as well as their inter-relationships.

## Customers

A customer is a simple mean of grouping users and providing such users with a customized webcampak background color and logo. Users are not required to be attached to a customer, but if they do, they can only be attached to one.

* __Name__: Customer Name, this field is only available for administrative purposes and is not visible to the end user.
* __BG Color__: Hexadecimal color for Webcampak Desktop background. If left empty, the default webcampak background color will be displayed.
* __BG Logo__: A customer-specific logo (usually a PNG file) can be uploaded into the watermark directory of the wpresources account. If left empty the system will display Webcampak logo

## Configuration

By default, webcampak is pre-configured with three different groups:

* __Admin__: Can access all configuration screens on the system
* __Configure__: Can access configuration screens for authorized sources. General configuration settings are not available
