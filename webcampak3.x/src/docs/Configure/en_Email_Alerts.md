# Email Alerts

The email alerts configuration screen can be accessed by clicking on "Webcampak > Configuration > Email Alerts".

[![Email Alerts Menu](images/desktop.menu.configuration.alerts.en.png "Email Alerts Menu")](images/desktop.menu.configuration.alerts.en.png "Click to see the full image.")

This featured is used to declare when pictures are expected to be captured for some of the sources. Webcampak can then trigger alerts based on deviation from this schedule. 

[![Email Alerts](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.en.png "Email Alerts")](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.en.png "Click to see the full image.")

Each line represents an hour, each column a minute. By default, the system only displays one day (selected on the top-right of the window), but it can be configured to display the full week.

Clicking in the grid will select the corresponding date and time.

## Edit Calendar

Since it would be extremely tedious to select a large number of capture slots, the "Edit Calendar" section can be used to manage addition and deletion from this calendar.

[![Add slot to calendar](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.edit-calendar.en.png "Add slot to calendar")](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.edit-calendar.en.png "Click to see the full image.")

In the example above, the system will add one picture every 5 minutes, on Mondays between 8:00 and 16:00.

[![Resulting calendar](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.calendar-add.en.png "Resulting calendar")](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.calendar-add.en.png "Click to see the full image.")

Users can also "clear" some of the capture slots.

[![Delete from calendar](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.edit-calendar-deletion.en.png "Delete from calendar")](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.edit-calendar-deletion.en.png "Click to see the full image.")

The above example will remove from the calendar, one picture every 5 minutes, on Mondays between 12:00 and 14:00.

[![Resulting calendar](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.calendar-remove.en.png "Resulting calendar")](images/desktop.configuration.emailalerts.calendar-remove.en.png "Click to see the full image.")

Once users are satisfied with the result, they can save the alert calendar and start using it for their source.
